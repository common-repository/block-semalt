Block Semalt from crawling your website.  

== Description ==

This plugin will add the needed script to block Semalt’s bot from crawling your site.

How it works:
It will take any request to your site from a Semalt bot and redirect it back to them.  This will help give you a more accurate indication of the traffic that you are getting to your site.
